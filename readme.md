## Quick Filter By

Mozilla Thunderbird extension that that adds a "Quick Filter By" messages list context menu which greatly speeds up 
creation of a Quick Filter for the most common use cases. Supports filtering by Sender, Recipient and a 
Subject line.

> Note: this is, essentially, a modification of a [sample extension](https://github.com/thundernest/sample-extensions/tree/master/filter). 
> I've removed a menu item entry and rearranged context menu a bit. **All credit goes to the original authors.**
